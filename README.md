This project predicts the amount of rainfall based on historical weather data. It uses
Random Forest Regression to analyze key weather parameters like temperature, humidity,
and wind speed.

Dependencies:
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn

Usage:
1. Load the dataset (CSV file with weather parameters).
2. Train the Random Forest model.
3. Predict rainfall based on input features.
